I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the School of Computer Science, Fudan University, where I work under the supervision of Prof. Yu-Gang Jiang (IEEE Fellow) and Prof. Zuxuan Wu. Before this, I received my BS degree from the University of Michigan. My research interests include **continual learning**, **transfer learning**, and **large language models**. If you are interested in potential collaborations, please feel free to email me at chenhran21@m.fudan.edu.cn.
